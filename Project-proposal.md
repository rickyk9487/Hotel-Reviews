### Summary:
Build a hotel recommender based on user similarities created from past reviews
on TripAdvisor.

### Motivation:
"Companies such as Marriott and Disney have realized that hospitality is a data-intensive 
business and that there is a wealth of creative strategies and tactics that can be found 
when the data is analyzed by professionals. Yet, even for these big brands the single biggest 
obstacle to making data-driven progress is their inability to find enough qualified talent to 
fill their analytics positions." -- Michele Walters, Co-Founder, Origin World Labs


### Deliverables:
TBD

### Data Sources:
Data was obtained by Professor Hongning Wang. He and co-authors have accompanying machine
learning papers discovering latent aspects in the rating.
