### Summary:
Build a hotel recommender based on user similarities created from past reviews
on TripAdvisor.

### Motivation:
Hotel data science has a plethora of untapped potential.

"Companies such as Marriott and Disney have realized that hospitality is a data-intensive 
business and that there is a wealth of creative strategies and tactics that can be found 
when the data is analyzed by professionals. Yet, even for these big brands the single biggest 
obstacle to making data-driven progress is their inability to find enough qualified talent to 
fill their analytics positions." -- Michele Walters, Co-Founder, Origin World Labs [article by Michele Watlters](http://hotelexecutive.com/business_review/3619/hotel-data-science-a-new-profession-for-the-new-era-of-advanced-hospitality)

### Deliverables:
User will be able to link their TripAdvisor reviews and destination to receive a 
rank of hotel recommendations.

### Data Sources:
Data was obtained by Professor Hongning Wang. He and co-authors have accompanying machine
learning papers discovering latent aspects in the rating.
Overview of data:
`2232 Hotels, 37181 Reviews, 34187 Reviewers, 96.5 Avg Len, [3.92-1.23, 3.929+1.23] Rating.`
